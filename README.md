## Description 

My project is a Java program designed to help a small business manage a list of drivers by finding, viewing, and booking available ones. The Driver class represents each driver, with instance variables like name, rating, distance, and available, and getter and setter methods to access and update these values. The UserStory class creates an array of Driver objects and includes methods to find the closest available driver, print available drivers, and book a driver by setting their availability to "No." I used conditional statements in the methods to filter available drivers, and iteration to loop through the driver list. This project meets the User Story goals by making it easier for the business owner to manage drivers and quickly find the closest available one.
